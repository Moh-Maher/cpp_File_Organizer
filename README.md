# Installation:

The main steps to install the program are:

-    Navigate to the main directory
-    Run the command "make"
-    This should produce the file "libmode.a" and send a copy to the "lib" subdirectory
-    If needed, "make clean" can be used to remove any files created during compiling.

# Running the program:

To test the program, run the following command:

-    Type "make test" in the main directory
-    This will create the executable file "MODE.out"
-    Run the program by specifying the target folder, like this: "./MODE.out /path/to/the/target/folder"

That's it! CPP_File_Organizer is a simple tool that can help you keep your folders organized and tidy. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to contribute to the project.

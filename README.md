# Installation:

The main steps are to run make in the main directory. This should produce the file
libmode.a and and also send a copy to the lib subdirectory.
"make clean" can be used to remove many of the files created during compiling.

# Run Test:
type "make test" to create the EXECUTABLE file MODE.out, which must be run with specifying the target folder. (./MODE.out /path/to/the/target/folder).
